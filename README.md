# App Gallery Showcase

A beautiful web application to showcase your projects, similar to Hugging Face Spaces. Built with Flask and TailwindCSS.

## Features

- Modern card-based layout
- Responsive design
- Like counter for each app
- Tags support
- Author attribution

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the application:
```bash
python app.py
```

3. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:5000`

## Adding Your Apps

Currently, the apps are defined in the `app.py` file. In a production environment, you would want to:
1. Set up a database to store app information
2. Create an admin interface to add/edit apps
3. Implement user authentication
4. Add image upload functionality
